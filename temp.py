Reflections
-----------
- It would be nice to simply specify fields as parameters and use the same class for all 
  OpenFDA searches. However, the subclass system I've put in place here is more appropriate 
  because the data return for each search requires some post-retrieval processing. 
- The query being used to test this code only returned 43 results. Other similar queries 
  returned more (>500) but closer inspection revealed the drugs were manufactured by companies 
  other than AstraZeneca. 
- With more time, and perhaps outside of a 'challenge' setting, I would have
  made some effort to clarify the meaning of the phrase "AstraZeneca medinine". Does it mean those sold 
  by AZ? Produced by AZ? Manafactured by AZ? Researched by AZ? 


Answers to other questions
--------------------------

How would you code a model to predict the number of ingredients for next year? Note: Your predictions don't have to be good !

- I think this is probably quite a difficult task because I do not expect the number of ingredients 
  contained in a drug to be correlated with time. Drug ingredients depend on the mechanistic requirements 
  of a therapy, it doesn't necessarily matter *when* the drug is produced. 
  - Route of administration may be better predictor for number of ingredients in a drug, given that there 
    seems to be significantly more ingredients in oral drugs than other drugs. However, I still think that 
    there may be other predictors that would suit the problem better, i.e. disease type maybe?  
- If after expressing my concerns regarding the problem definition, I was still asked to try and 
  use year to predict number of medicines in AstraZeneca medicines, I would first clarify the meaning
  of the phrase "AstraZeneca medicine" and to ensure i had the correct data. Then I would try to 
  model a trend (assuming one can be found) with an autoregressive model.
  Failing that we could try a recurrent neural network with (maybe) a LSTM architecture, 
  using keras for a simple first implementation. Note however, it would be 
  important to ensure we had much more than the 43 data points for training/testing. 

Could you find the most common drug interactions for AstraZeneca medicines?

- I would get the set of all AstraZeneca medicines and then the subset of pairs of compounds that interact. Then I'd 
  find the pair of compounds that occur most frequently in AstraZeneca drugs. 


How would you deploy your analysis/model as a tool that other users can use?

- Could be a library/package/module, an app, command line program or full blown software. All of these could 
  implement an interface that enables users to enter their inputs (i.e. their new instances of 
  year or year and route of administration) to a copy of the fully trained model. 
  The model would be evaluated and the output (i.e. predictions) returned to the 
  user.
  - It would be interesting to implement a piece of software (like a platform) that contains many such models with a UI. 
    This model would then be just one of a list of useful models that can be used to make a variety of predictions
